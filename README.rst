SimuPy Flight Vehicle Toolkit
=============================

Vehicle flight simulation is an important part of the innovation of aerospace vehicle technology. The NASA Engineering Safety Center (NESC) has identified and addressed the need to verify flight vehicle simulations through their work on the `“Six degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) Flight Simulation Test Cases.” <https://nescacademy.nasa.gov/flightsim/>`_ The author was prompted to develop tools that would allow for the rapid implementation of simulations for novel vehicle concepts including hypersonic re-entry vehicles and urban air mobility vehicles.

This software library leverages open source scientific computing tools to implement an efficient simulation framework for flight vehicles in Python. Equations of motion are composed in blocks using the SimuPy library, an open source Python alternative to Simulink, solves the resulting differential equations using SciPy’s wrappers for standard Fortran implementations. Dynamics equations of the inertial state variables for the position, orientation, and their corresponding rates for integration are developed using the SymPy symbolic library and implemented using code generation. Kinematics equations are implemented through symbolic definition and code generation as well as leveraging other open source software that implements useful functions, such as the solutions to the inverse geodesy problem.

Library Design
--------------

.. |SimuPyAPI| replace:: SimuPy's ``DynamicalSystem`` interface
.. _SimuPyAPI: https://simupy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/api.html>

The SimuPy Flight Vehicle Toolkit API is designed to prioritize explicit and modular models, to facilitate adherance to best practices from the scientific Python community, and to follow SimuPy design principles. The library provides a ``Planet`` and ``Vehicle`` that implement |SimuPyAPI|_. This API separation was designed to reflect the modeling distinction between the two bodies being simuated. This separation could have been reflected in other ways; indeed within the ``Planet`` and ``Vehicle`` classes there is a namespace separation between model components. However, it is often convenient to break SimuPy models into distinct systems when intermediate signals may be used for multiple purposes. In particular, the separation allows easy access to the vehicle's sensed acceleration which is an important measurement for flight vehicles, particularly entry vehicles. Due to the disciplined modeling approach set out by SimuPy where the output of systems with state are not dependent on the input, a vehicle whose input changed acceleration could not be modeled without separating the ``Vehicle``. In the future, convenience functions will provided for common ``BlockDiagram`` manipulations like connecting guidance, navigation, or control models to reduce the learning curve for new users.

The ``Vehicle`` class provides the state-less dynamics (angular and translational acceleration) of the flight vehicle. It is constructed by

.. code:: python

    vehicle = Vehicle(
        m, I_xx, I_yy, I_zz, I_xy, I_yz, I_xz, x_com, y_com, z_com, # intertia
        base_aero_coeffs, x_mrc, y_mrc, z_mrc, S_A, a_l, b_l, c_l, d_l, # aero
        input_aero_coeffs, input_force_moment, # extra callbacks for control modeling
        input_aero_coeffs_idx, input_force_moment_idx, # routing for control callbacks
        dim_extra_input, # total number of extra (control) inputs
    )

The ``Planet`` class provides the kinematic equations of motion used to drive the position,  orientaiton, and their corresponding rates based on the dynamics modeled by the ``Vehicle``. The ``Plenet`` is constructed by 

.. code:: python

    planet = Planet(gravity, winds, atmosphere, planetodetics)

NESC Test Cases
---------------

..
    TODO: update this section -- retain reference to NESC data and explain
    the local copy; possibly provide the argument information

A number of the NESC Atmospheric test cases have been implemented to verify the implementation and derivation of the equations of motion. These are located in the `nesc_test_cases` directory. To run, simply execute any of `nesc_case##.py` files or the `run_nesc_cases.py` which will iterate through test cases that have been implemented. These scripts will attempt to load the NESC reference results from the parent directory and plot the results along with the results from the SimuPy implemntation. To include the NESC results in the comparison plots, download the `Atmospheric trajectory data <https://nescacademy.nasa.gov/src/flightsim/Datasets/Atmospheric_checkcases.zip>`_ and unzip the `Atmospheric_checkcases` directory to the root `simupy_flight` directory. You can place the `Atmospheric_checkcases` directory in different location by changing the `data_relative_path` variable in the `nesc_testcase_helper.py` script.

Installation
------------

Simupy-flight doesn't work with the latest version of Simupy, for now manually checkout an older working revision

.. code:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/simupy/simupy.git
   $ cd simupy
   $ git checkout a7f0aec4353a41b2c9ab3aa76696f978e2f37742
   $ cd .. 
   $ pip install -e simupy

To install, clone the repository and install with pip

.. code:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/nasa/simupy-flight.git
   $ pip install simupy-flight/

welcomed and appreciated.

Bug fix pull requests are always welcome. For feature additions, breaking
changes, etc. check if there is an open issue discussing the change and
reference it in the pull request. If there isn't one, it is recommended to open
one with your rationale for the change before spending significant time
preparing the pull request.

Ideally, new/changed functionality should come with tests and documentation. If
you are new to contributing, it is perfectly fine to open a work-in-progress
pull request and have it iteratively reviewed.

For pull requests to be accepted, all contributors must have a contributor's agreement on file with NASA. We will provide contributors with additional information during the review process.
